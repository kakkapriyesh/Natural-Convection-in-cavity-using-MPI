# kakkapriyesh-MPI_in_Python
These codes will be useful for engineers (CFD/FEM) to learn MPI.The code is universal for any aspect ratio and other parameters. 
Following are the codes:
a) Stream_vorticity_formulations: Heated cavity is being solved using stream vorticity formulation and parallel processors.
b)
